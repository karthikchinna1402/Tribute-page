            <h1 class="title">History of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h1>
            <p>  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.
                Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai Devi. Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates.
                </p><p> mother was Jijabai the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, 
                a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.
            </p>
            <p>In 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji took the Torna Fort, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur court due to the ailment of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found there. 
                In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including Purandar, Kondhana and Chakan.</p><p> Also, he brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati, and Indapur under his direct control.
                 He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad.</p>
            <p>Shivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he was still technically a Mughal zamindar or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule his de facto domain. 
                A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha leaders, to whom he was technically equal.
                It would also provide the Hindu Marathas with a fellow Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise ruled by Muslims.</p>
            <p>Shivaji is known for his liberal and tolerant religious policies. While Hindus were relieved to practice their religion freely under a Hindu ruler, Shivaji not only allowed Muslims to practice without harassment, but supported their ministries with endowments. When Aurangzeb imposed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims on 3 April 1679, Shivaji wrote a strict letter to Aurangzeb criticising his tax policy.</p>
            <p>
                Shivaji demonstrated great skill in creating his military organisation, which lasted until the demise of the Maratha Empire. 
                His strategy rested on leveraging his ground forces, naval forces, and series of forts across his territory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji died around 3 April 1680 at the age of 50, on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti. The cause of Shivaji's death is disputed. British records states that Shivaji died of bloody flux being sick for 12 days.
                 In a contemporary work in Portuguese, the Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, the recorded cause of death of Shivaji is anthrax.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was one of the greatest rulers born in India, who saved the people from atrocities against them from Mughal rulers.
